# Feedback

A feedback processing system for customers who have completed a tour.

It includes:
- a subsystem for notifying target customers via email with additional reminders in case of no response
- an interface for providing feedback and rating service components based on the type of tour product

Part of a large Laravel HMVC project.

The code was created by me during my work at an internal tourism operator.
